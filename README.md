# Task-4
Responsive Website (Task 4)

📌 What I Did

Took an existing desktop-only webpage and made it mobile-friendly.

Added CSS media queries to handle smaller screen sizes (max-width: 768px).

Adjusted layout, text, and images for better viewing on mobile devices.

⚙️ How It Works

Desktop view: Two-column layout with horizontal navigation.

Mobile view:

Columns stack vertically.

Navigation menu stacks vertically for easier tapping.

Font sizes and spacing are reduced for smaller screens.

Images are responsive (max-width: 100%).
